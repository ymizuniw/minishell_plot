Excellent — this is a good attempt, but the function `gen_tree()` as written has several **logical and structural problems** that would cause malformed or inconsistent ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees). Let’s analyze them systematically.

---

## 🧩 1. **Parent–child linkage broken during swap**
---

## 🪜 2. **AST growth direction reversed**

Your recursive pattern:

```c
node->left = gen_tree(node->left, token->next, subshell, 1);
```

causes the tree to grow *rightward* for each operator, but your swap logic (`swap_and_set_right_node`) sets the previous subtree as the *right child* — this reverses operator precedence.

For logical/pipe operators, **the left side** should represent the command *before* the operator, and **the right side** should represent *after*.
Your code swaps them in the wrong direction, so parsing:

```
cmd1 | cmd2 && cmd3
```

produces a tree like:

```
    &&
     \
      |
       \
        cmd3
```

instead of

```
    &&
   /  \
  |   cmd3
 / \
cmd1 cmd2
```

## 🧱 3. **Subshell recursion never consumes tokens properly**

```c
node->subtree = gen_tree(node->subtree, token, 1, pipeline);
```

You pass the **same token pointer** again without consuming it, so recursion will loop infinitely.
You must advance to the next token after encountering `(` and stop when you find `)`.

**Fix:**

```c
t_token *inner = token->next;
while (inner && inner->type != TK_RPAREN)
    inner = inner->next;
node->subtree = gen_tree(NULL, token->next, 1, 0);
token = inner; // skip to after ')'
```

---

## ⚙️ 4. **Command node creation logic is interleaved with redirection logic**

The block handling `TK_WORD` and `TK_DOLLER` both appends argv **and** handles redirects **at the same level**.
This conflates token categories. You should first gather all words into argv, then separately parse redirections.

```c
while (token && is_word_or_redirect(token->type)) {
    if (is_redirect(token->type))
        node->cmd->redir = parse_redirection(...);
    else
        append_argv(node->cmd->argv, expand_value(token));
    token = token->next;
}
```

---

## 🧠 5. **Memory safety and undefined fields**

* You never allocate `node->cmd` or `node->pipeline` before dereferencing:

  ```c
  node->pipeline->in_pipeline = true;  // segfault
  node->cmd->argv = realloc(...);      // segfault
  ```

  → must `calloc()` them first.

---

## 🔁 6. **Lack of return propagation and root maintenance**

When a new operator node replaces the current root, you never update `ast`.
That means the function always returns the *last node created*, not the *root* of the entire tree.

You need something like:

```c
if (is_operator(token->type)) {
    node = make_operator_node(token);
    node->left = ast;
    ast->parent = node;
    ast = node;  // promote to new root
}
```

---

## 🧩 7. **Token consumption logic incomplete**

`gen_tree()` never returns the token position it stopped at.
This breaks when you recurse because you can’t tell where parsing ended.
A correct recursive descent parser typically returns `(new_ast, next_token)` pair.

---

## ✅ Corrected Structural Sketch

Below is a minimal *structurally correct skeleton*:

```c
t_ast *gen_tree(t_token **cur)
{
    t_ast *left = parse_simple_command(cur);

    while (*cur && is_operator((*cur)->type)) {
        t_ast *op = alloc_node();
        set_operator_type(op, (*cur)->type);
        (*cur) = (*cur)->next;
        op->left = left;
        left->parent = op;
        op->right = gen_tree(cur);
        left = op;
    }
    return left;
}
```

This properly builds binary trees with correct operator precedence and token progression.

Would you like me to rewrite a **corrected minimal `gen_tree()` implementation** that respects bash operator precedence (`&&`, `||`, `|`) and parentheses (subshells)? It’ll be about ~60 lines, self-contained and ready to integrate.

// Bash scripts often begin with #! /bin/bash (assuming that Bash has been installed in /bin), since this ensures that Bash will be used to interpret the script, even if it is executed under another shell. It’s a common idiom to use env to find bash even if it’s been installed in another directory: #!/usr/bin/env bash will find the first occurrence of bash in $PATH.

// The current working directory.
// The file creation mode mask.
// Shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables exported for the command, passed in the environment (see Environment).
